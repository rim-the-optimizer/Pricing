# Designing pricing and compensation schemes by integrating matching and routing models for crowd-shipping systems Adapted Version
### Tho V. Le, Satish V. Ukkusuri, Jiawei Xue, Tom Van Woensel created a MILP that combines matching-, routing-, compensation- and pricing decisions. With this programm it is possible to create the tours, match the drivers and determine the compensations and pricings in order to maximize the profit.

The model of this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554520308516) is modified. This [modified version](https://www.github.com/rim-the-optimizer/Pricing/blob/main/pricingmodel.ipynb) can be run in Python and solved by Gurobi.


In order to run the code use this [collab-link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rim-the-optimizer/Pricing/blob/main/pricing.ipynb).
